<div class="about">
    <p>I was born in Cluj, Romania on October 31st, 1976. I emigrated to the United States in October of 1989 and lived in Hamburg, NJ for three months. My parents found better jobs in Lawrenceville, New Jersey so we moved in a development right across from <a href="http://www.rider.edu/" target="_blank">Rider University</a>, foreshadowing my later years when I would receive a merit scholarship to attend <a href="http://www.rider.edu/" target="_blank">Rider</a>. In 1999, I graduated <font color = "#19A347"><b>Summa Cum Laude</b></font> with a <font color = "#19A347"><b>3.868 GPA</b></font>.</p>
    <p><font color = "#19A347"><b>My degree in CIS (Computer Information Systems)</b></font> taught me both business and computer programming. After my graduation I worked in marketing, management, advertising, database development and computer programming (front-end and back-end; on the Windows platform and on Linux). For my first job at <font color = "#19A347"><b>United Languages,</b></font> I used all these skills. <font color = "#19A347"><b>United Languages</b></font> was a small start-up, owned by my father. My computer skills were a great help because I set up the company's database and worked on its website along with my father. When my father could run United Languages without my help, in 2003, I started work as a full time employee at <a href="http://www.olsonresearchgroup.com/" target="_blank">The Olson Research Group</a> (a medical research corporation). I was hired to code in JavaScript but also to teach this language to my teammates. The company used a software application called <a href="http://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/download/info/ssiweb.php" target="_blank">Sawtooth</a> to create medical research surveys. Adding the JavaScript code to this application made our surveys more effective, more flexible, and easier to navigate. Using JavaScript, I added features that the our competitors could not have, which made <a href="http://www.olsonresearchgroup.com/" target="_blank">The Olson Research Group</a> exceedingly more profitable. When a company becomes aware of the power of technology and knows how to use it correctly, it can dominate its competition. It is unfortunate that too many companies view their websites as luxuries rather than necessities. Inevitably this is the downfall of many small businesses, who do not realize that investing in a great website and an efficient web application can be much more profitable in the long-run.  </p>
    <p>In 2004, I moved to Washington DC where I worked mainly as as a full time employee, for companies who sent me to contract for different  Government branches - The Library of Congress, The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and The Navy. </p>
    <p>I worked mainly as a back-end programmer, coding in a variety of languages: Visual Basic, ASP, ASP.NET, VB.NET, AJAX, SQL. However, I still used JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the front-end work. </p>
    <p>During this time, I took classes for which I earned the <font color = "#19A347"><b>certificate of completion</b></font> for <font color = "#19A347"><b>Metastorm BPM, Crystal Enterprise, Crystal Reports, Business Objects XI.</b></font> </p>
    <p>I also learned how to write complex stored procedures and to create and maintain new databases using mainly SQL Server, and at times, Oracle. I created new databases, merged databases. I moved data form Excel to MS Access than into SQL Server. Later, I created SQL queries in order to build reports to extract the new data. I designed new tables with the proper primary and foreign keys, the user permissions. Particularly while working at Velocitel, I focused on optimizing the existing stored procedure for scalability and speed. I learned how to create and use indexes, virtual tables, and AJAX to create scalable reports and applications.</p>
    <p>After moving to San Francisco, I moved away from the Windows platform. Starting in 2009, I worked mainly as a remote contractor in LAMP (PHP), and also as a front-end developer using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML 5 and CSS3. </p>
    <p>I learned CMS applications such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, e-Commerce applications such as <a href="http://www.mivamerchant.com/" target="_blank">Miva Merchant</a>. </p>
    <p>Currently my focus is working with <font color = "#19A347"><b>PHP 5 (CodeIgniter), JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, HTML 5, CSS 3.</b></font> My favorite <font color = "#19A347"><b>IDE and editors</b></font> are <font color = "#19A347"><b> PhpStorm 3.0, Eclipse, Netbeans and X-code.</b></font> Database: <font color = "#19A347"><b>MySQL.</b></font></p>
    <p>I coded my portfolio website site (<a href="http://theonj.com/" title="My professional portfolio website" target="_blank">theonj.com</a>) in <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>. </p>
    <p>I also used Wordpress for the following sites: <a href="http://theonj.com/?p=189">Rebel Events, and <a href="http://theonj.com/?p=189">Sunland Ranch</a>.</a></p>
    <p>In <a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, I am currently working on a website which is meant to advertise an artist's work, as well as sell customized jewelry boxes: <a href = "http://theeval.info/" target = "blank">Cecilia Schmitt's Portfolio Site</a><br /></p>

<p>Every generation worries about the next, and many fear that the increase in technology will build an online generation made up of people who communicate online using various social and business networks so much that they will lose the ability to communicate efficiently in real life. This is one possibility but there is another. German philosopher Frederich Nietzsche predicted an oncoming revolution of the intellect. We have gone through the Industrial Revolution and are currently experiencing the Technology Revolution. I believe that in time the Technology Revolution could be the base for the Intellectual Revolution. </p>
<p>There are many schools of thought on this but I believe that most children are born with a high propensity for learning, grand curiosity and energy – all traits which if developed can turn them into unusually intelligent, creative and productive adults. Unfortunately, the anti-education climate in American schools mixed with the sense that doing the minimum amount of work possible, leads equal rewards, as working harder, are both destroying this innate propensity. Up until now the social status was determined by the social position of a child in school, and bookworms as a rule tended to be ostracized. For many kids it was not worth studying if it meant losing their popularity. However, the increase online socialization could change all this. Popularity could be determined by online interactions rather than social interactions. If this is the case, the peer pressure to be popular rather than clever will diminish. At the same time, having the best website, the most interesting account on Facebook, and be ready at any point to enter in a clever conversation requires learning. Therefore, it is quite possible that because of the online culture, the future generation will praise intelligence and wit rather than looks, sportsmanship (this can be replaced by drug addiction or the tendency to take behave recklessly, confidently and take unnecessarily dangerous risks) and fashion, which are the current ingredients needed to make a high school kid popular.</p>
<p>Case in point, a television show called Malcolm in the Middle aired an episode during which the youngest son teaches himself to play the piano but does it in secret not only from his peers but also from his parents. It is a dire situation indeed when the parents fail to support their children from certain interests because of the fear that the field is too competitive. Acting, music, painting, fashion design, modeling, and professional sports (such as playing for the NFL or the NBA) are all fields where many try to succeed but fail, not because they lack talent but because the competition is extremely high and the number of spots are limited. However, not all the kids who play piano must also learn to play the Rach III. Often these skills are enjoyable and if a career cannot develop from them, the fact that the mind is used to a variety of skills is, in fact, the key to success. Nietzsche debunked Aristotle’s idea that virtuosity (the training and development of a certain skill) must begin at an early age to be effective. Several people have proven this to be false to an extreme degree. William S. Burges published his first novel at the age of 39, and author Flora Thompson published the first volume of her semi-autobiographical Lark Rise to Candleford trilogy at the age of 63. A remarkable case that of <a href="http://www.odditycentral.com/pics/mammy-rock-the-granny-dj.html" title="DJ Ruth">DJ Ruth</a> who taught herself how to DJ and had her first gig at the age of 69. She is now, at the age of 73, one of the most famous DJs in Europe.</p>

<p>I mentioned these examples to establish two points. Primarily, children need the encouragement of their parents and their peers in order to succeed, but unfortunately in the United States today too many parents leave their children alone for hours to watch television or go online. The positive in this is that more and more children prefer the Internet to television. And because so much of what they see done online, they themselves can do by learning programming, it is quite likely that many of these children will develop strong technological skills even without the aid of their parents. Children who can start to teach themselves are much more likely to be successful than those who depend on their parents to take them to piano lessons, etc. I see the growth in technology as changing drastically the way in which children develop. They learn independence at an early age. An independent child knows how to self-motivate and is much better equipped with the tools he or she will need to resist peer pressure.</p>
<p>Secondly, as society sees examples such as those of DJ Ruth, the mentality that all that can be learned must be learned from an early age changes. If this utterly detrimental way of thought can be overcome, even the adults who had few opportunities to learn as children (due either to bad education or parents who sent them to deal drugs rather than do their homework), realize that it is never to late to learn. This trend has already begun, and the proof for this is the high number of older people who are enrolling into Colleges and Universities.</p>

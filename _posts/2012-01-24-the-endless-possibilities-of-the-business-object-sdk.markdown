<p>Because of corporations’ reliance on accurate and timely data, the Business Objects Software Development Kit (SDK) was developed to describe business-intelligence functions such as "list reports," "view report," "refresh report," "drill on report," and web services. Accessing data through the web makes pre-established point-to-point connections and IT integration obsolete, while escalating the flow of Business Intelligence (BI) information among various departments within a company.</p>
<p>The magic behind the SDK comes from its unlimited capability to expand out-of-the-box applications. The SDK contains libraries (such as DLLs), a reference guide to the API, tutorials, sample code, conceptual documentation, and several other features used to customize the application framework. These customizations can change an application from static to dynamic; alter its interface; create new components, capabilities or processes. Therefore, it makes Crystal Enterprise more efficient and productive. </p>
<p>With the aid of the SDK, the software engineer can transform a static application and make it dynamic. Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, each trip to the server is treated as a new request, and the server remembers nothing about the clients between page submissions, applications tend to be static as well. With the use of the SDK, a developer can alter the application’s code to make it remember a user’s actions and data input. A dynamic application can contain dynamic parameters that remember and display each user’s previous entries. It is easy to see how this makes the application so much more efficient due to the fact that the user no longer has to re-enter the data each time he/she enters the program. A dynamic application could retrieve data directly from one or several databases, and display it based on certain pre-programmed queries, saving the time required to enter the data by hand. It does this automatically and with guaranteeing accuracy. </p>
<p>With the use of the SDK, the application’s interface can be changed according to any client’s preferences. The client could replace the Crystal Enterprise logo with his company logo, change the colors and graphics, remove unwanted buttons; update the elements and controls on a page; or add new ones. </p>
<p>While the out-of-the-box application contains features seemingly useful to all businesses on an average, it is not proficient for any one business in particular without alterations to meet its needs. </p>
<p>While creating a report in Crystal Reports, users might run into problems that cannot be solved without a change to the web application. A report with a high number of parameters, for instance, while easily developed in Crystal Reports, would pose problems once deployed on the web for those users who have to enter the data in each parameter, each time they start the report. There are several solutions to this problem but they all require the use of the SDK. The dynamic parameters mentioned above would limit the data entry. Stopping the users from scheduling the report without setting the parameters first would eliminate null or undefined parameter values (data validation). </p>
<p>The SDK’s compiled help file (.chm) can teach programmers to perform such complex tasks by simply following its hierarchical framework. In other words, since everything is organized under headings and tabs, and every object is connected to its methods, properties and parent objects, the SDK is quite easy to navigate. These clear and concise instructions are packed with examples and sample code to facilitate understanding of complex applications. </p>

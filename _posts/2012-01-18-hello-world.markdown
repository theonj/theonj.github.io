<p>While reading an article in the Wall Street Journal called <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904060604576570574190457198.html">Don’t Dismiss Office Politics—Teach It</a>, I begun thinking about my own and others’ experiences with this subject. The article focuses on executives, but the role of office politics in non-executive jobs is just as critical.</p>
<p>Most office politics are counterproductive.</p>
<p>Overall, politics are just a means of establishing and assessing a hierarchy scale. In an office, however, productivity should trump personalities and ego gratifications.</p>
<p>Most office politics issues create friction because of false illusions and inflated egos. It makes the office too much like high school, or worse, middle school. Those who are popular do what they want - even if it depletes productivity and promotes idleness and the people who focus mainly on their work are often berated without cause. Worse, the jealousy of the unproductive builds a hostile environment for the workers who are dedicated and absorbed in their work.</p>
<p>Whoa! Now we’ve gone back to elementary school. People are shunned, cliques are formed, and productivity goes down.</p>
<p>Then the question arises: why are so many managers stuck with this attitude?</p>
<p>One of the reasons I noticed is that most managers are not qualified. Nevertheless they take the job because of the power, prestige, and salary increase.</p>
<p>Another reason that goes along with this, especially in the technology industry, is the self-illusion many engineers have that they can manage and still be hands-on technical. This is an extremely rare combination. Most often it doubles their working hours, making them realize that they are working two jobs with the salary of only one. This is something that few managers are willing to do, but this clearly means that a managerial job is not as prestigious and high paying as they believed it. This is difficult for some managers to accept. Their inability to see their move as a mistake, creates a form of repressed anger. It also prompts them to stick to their job, despite its disadvantages. They put on the farce that all is well and that they are fully capable of doing a two-men job. This false illusion, however, builds a feeling of inadequacy. They become defensive and highly resistant of criticism particularly from their subordinates. To surmise they become incapable of dealing with the people they were hired to manage, and to hide this, they blame all that goes wrong on their employees.</p>
<p>The whole company suffers, and this is only the beginning. The employees who were previously excited to work become disillusioned, while the employees who enjoyed slacking off do so even more than usual. The employees who are simply lost have no one to turn to, and either quit or hide their computer screen to play <a href="http://chrome.angrybirds.com/">Angry Birds</a> with such a level of concentration that anyone walking by will get the impression that work and productivity have increased since the last change in management.</p>
<p>The managers must keep their positions somehow, so the question remains: what to do? What can they do, and what can the employees do? The people on top are fooled so they’re out of this equation.</p>
<p>No one can have all the answers, but part of the solution requires the involvement of high-level executives. The entire disaster could have been avoided if they were trained to recognize talent, to promote according to skill and ability, not simply according to seniority. It is imperative that all employees take an honest look at themselves and what they can do. If you are putting in 60 hours a week now hands on and you want a manager’s title, are you willing to double your hours to 120 hours a week to still be hands on? Assuming you have managerial skills, which most people don’t, do you really want to be and can be an effective manger? If not, don’t apply.</p>
<p>The simplest solution and one that I hardly ever see exercised is to impose penalties on workers that do not do their job. I have seen employees from junior members to CEOs working the minimum requirements or hardly working at all with enormous consequences on the company and its clients. Despite this, corrective action is hardly ever undertaken. This is not surprising considering the indecisiveness and fear of most managers. Moreover the ones who have to reprimand are the ones who need reprimanding the most - afraid that their own faults will be brought out. This attitude is that of a child who fears parental reproval more than anything. A company is designed for profit not love so this attitude is not only unacceptable, it is counterintuitive, irrational and all in all silly.</p>
<p>On a side note: no one can discount the importance of praise and caring in a manger. Such an attitude can not only motivate but even create a desire to work. Changing work into something enjoyable is really the key to spectacular management, because that which is done out of joy, is done well.</p>
<p>And if someone is not performing up to par, it’s time to fire him or her!</p>
<p>And do not do it based on your feelings! Do it based on performance! -- hmmm... shouldn't this be self-evident?</p>
<p>If you are fair and rational, you will realize you may have to quit or demote yourself if <em>you</em> are the problem you cannot fix. We all know how unlikely this is. Therefore the managers need regulators just like the rest of the employees.</p>
<p>A company might follow the examples of movie companies who hire a casting director with the sole job to hire and fire people based on proficiency, knowledge and skill.</p>
<p>Often it is employees who having specialized in one area, they know the answers better than the manager. In this case, it is the manger’s job is to notice these employees, review their ideas and apply them. The reason this hardly ever occurs is that managers are not willing to take the responsibility for risky decisions of which they are not certain.</p>
<p>Decisions and risks are the core of a manager’s job. A manager unable to make decisions for fear of consequences has already failed as a manager and does not deserve the title.</p>

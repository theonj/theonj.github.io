<strong>"Sit mens sana in corpore sano"</strong> is a wise statement made long ago by a Roman poet named Juvenal, which translates as: “a healthy mind in a healthy body.” From Seneca to Aristotle, the philosophers are all over this idea! But the wise western philosophers who created the health-care reform, seemed to have forgotten that a healthy body needs a healthy mind. Now that new healthcare reform enables all these healthy people to run around causing trouble, where’s the concern for healthy minds? I hear nothing of education reform. So I ask myself why not? Is it not important enough to implement? Is it a state secret? Or is it that the US government is content - maybe event prefers it that way - with a country full of healthy doltish people (politically accurate term: "special")?</p>
<p>Even if education on the University level remains untouched, what about high schools, junior high, and kindergarten? After all, the Universities in the United States are challenging and informative (the debate here is based on major, for certain majors they have the best teachers, and the best tools (such as well equipped chemistry labs, etc.), there is yet another problem. They are much too expensive for the average person, and with this an education reform could help, but giving more financial aid, particularly to the students who want to learn and have proven it through good graders. As it stands right now, most financial aid is based on need, and many people are recommending that staying unemployed and living in poverty for one year prior to applying for financial aid from the state or government, can improve a student's chances to getting an eduction which he or she is just slightly too rich to otherwise afford. This unfortunately teaches people at too young an age, that they can acquire more by not working, than by putting in the effort. Yes there are scholarships, but they are either limited to small sums or targeted mainly to the Undergraduate. Many students spend all they can afford or gather such a huge debt to get a Bachelor's degree that they cannot even consider moving on to a Master's or a PHD. </p>
<p>Or in those instances when students get a full tuition scholarship based on need or merit for their Bachelor's, the education systems stops all financial help there, despite the fact that a Bachelor's Degree is far from sufficient in a variety of different areas, such as Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Philosophy, Psychology, Literature, Liberal Arts. Basically that leaves Software Engineers and Business Majors as the only students, who can start a successful career with a Bachelor Degree only. It is also notable that in many countries, a person is not considered educated until he completes a Master's Degree, and the ideal is either PhD or a Doctoral Degree. However, due to the high costs of education, too many US students cannot afford to continue their education despite their great desire to learn.</p>
<p>Leaving Universities aside for the moment, however, there is so much that can be done early on, when education is even more critical. George Carlin hit the nail on the head when he said: “Just think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize half of them are even stupider!” Under this premise the logical conclusion is that the only way to raise the intelligence of the population is by raising the demands made upon the average student, which is certainly not accomplished with the use of standardized tests. The "no child left behind" mentality has harmed the system of education in this country by lowering the expectations for all the students, and measuring performance through <a href = "http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/mar99/vol56/num06/Why-Standardized-Tests-Don%27t-Measure-Educational-Quality.aspx" target = "blank">standardized tests.</a> This is dragging the clever students down. Many lose attention in class because they are too bored. If classes are easy and require no effort, the child will grow to learn that little effort is needed in order to succeed. Growing up with this concept is highly detrimental and difficult to change later on. Too many people who are used to taking the easy way out will have difficulty adjusting when hard work is demanded of them (by Universities, their jobs, or life in general...). Case in point, high school teachers are paid less than high school janitors. This cannot be because we want out students to aspire toward become janitors, but it could be that since the new health care bill is started to cover pre-existing conditions, the level of cleanliness in a school has become more important than the level of education. </p>
<p>With the health issue solved (I know this is still under a huge debate, but at the very least, an attempt <em>has</em> been made) what about the mind? Is education simply not an issue? As long as people are healthy enough to get into trouble, can the government really sit back and pat itself on the back?  What about the issues of gang wars, drug addiction, and crime? Those injured, while engaging in these risky, criminal activities, get healed quickly (and for free!) so they can return to making this a better country. Something about the logic in that last sentence leaves me pretty skeptical, and I start to worry whether this country has become a little like that snake that’s started to eat its own tail. In the end, it will devour itself (and it is debatable if the doctors can patch him up after that). The longer we ignore the need for education reform, the less likely it is that someone will teach the snake not to eat its own tail. As a side note for those who have gone through a poor education system are are unfamiliar with the metaphor, I want to explain that the snake represents our country's students, who are hungry for self-improvement, but due to a lack of adequate education, end up harming themselves (eating their own tail) by turning to risky and dangerous professions such as those of criminals, gangsters, or drug addicts.</p>

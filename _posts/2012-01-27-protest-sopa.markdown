<p>On January 18th, 2012 several websites went on strike and the following page showed up instead of the regular website:</p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/wikipedia-blackout_n_1212096.html"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-139" title="Stop SOPA" src="http://theonj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-27-at-12.29.42-AM-300x203.png" alt="" width="300" height="203" /></a></center><br />
This unanimous agreement was the first online strike in which I participated and possibly the first in the history of the Internet. Its purpose was to protest the SOPA bill, which if passed, could change the Internet by restricting its contents to an extreme which places the freedom of speech in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Simply because we are dealing with the Internet, freedom of speech should not be disregarded. On the contrary, this is a new medium, which helps many small business thrive. Particularly now that the economy is in such terrible shape, we cannot afford to destroy the Internet as the medium which allows many American business to thrive and to keep the population employed.</p>

<p>This issue is much more critical than most people realize and a protest to the streets should follow if this online protest goes unheeded. Nevertheless, it was creative of websites such as Wikipedia to go on strike. Information sites such as Wikipedia being down even for one day, made it difficult for people, who are almost fully dependent on the Internet, to do their work or complete their studies. Students might have had to find another site, or if that was down as well, even hit their local library. As much as I am a proponent of libraries, the ease of information access which the Internet provides must be protected.</p>

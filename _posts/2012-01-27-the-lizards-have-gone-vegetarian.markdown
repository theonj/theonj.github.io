Giant lizard discovered! And guess what?  He’s a vegetarian!<br />

<p>The 6.5-foot long lizard has special claws that allow it to reach its favorite fruits.  If he could stand up he could pass for a strange looking human.  Once he’s informed us that he’s a vegetarian, I figure the meat lovers would respect him, and the vegetarians would accept him as one of their own.\r\nUnless this is real life, where unfortunately those who are different are often rejected (and since he’s a lizard rejection = mauled, killed or destroyed).</p>
<p>In Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Frankenstein’s creature is a vegetarian.  Why is being a vegetarian associated so often with monstrosity?  First Frankenstein’s monster and now this cute and unique lizard…  The true abomination is the way meat is processed in the United States.  We have all seen videos of chickens raised by the thousands with barely enough space to move their little beaks.  Or have we?  Are we afraid that the truth about the way animals are raised for consumption might hurt our conscience when we sit down to scrumptious chicken appetizers followed by yummy veal?\r\nWell, the time has come, when a lizard is standing as an example for nutrition.  Can humans follow from his example, or will they continue their carnivore tradition, and catch, cook and turn him into dinner?  Have we reached a point where we destroy everything and anything with the capacity to teach us?</p>

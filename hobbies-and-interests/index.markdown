<p><font color = "green"><center><strong>Here are copies of my awards and photos that capture my love for photography, sports, and animals:</strong></center></font></p>
<p>[gallery caption = "off"]</p>
<p>My main hobbies are <strong>movie editing, 3D graphics - In 1997, I created all the graphics for a video game called Boomo - and programming - I am creating a website for selling clothes designed and sewn or knitted by me. I created the Moc Site in <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/" target="_blank">TWITTER BOOTSTRAP</a>. </p>
<p>I also enjoy reading and writing (I am the editor of a novel called Alpha Tales which is published and available for sale for the Kindle for $0.99 on Amazon. My interest in fashion and photography led to a new interest: modeling (please see my profile on <a href="http://www.jurgita.com/models-id362228.html" title="JURGITA MODEL">JURGITA MODELING AGENCY</a>).</p>
<p>I love atheletics (running, jogging, swimming) and sports</strong> (soccer, aerobics (kick-boxing, step aerobics, cycling, yoga), weight lifting, hiking, ice skating, jet-skiing, water rafting, ATVs and snowmobiles). I also do martical arts: wing chun.<br />

I love <strong>photography</strong> and lately I have become very interested in <strong>movie editing</strong>. The software I use the most is <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker#t1=overview" target="_blank">WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER</a> </p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1076" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://theonj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MeWithFilmCamera.jpg"><img src="http://theonj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MeWithFilmCamera-300x225.jpg" alt="Interests: Screenwriting, Filming, Editing" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-1076" /></a> Interests: Screenwriting, Filming, Editing[/caption]</p>
<p>I made the following video as a parody. It also helped me become more familiar with <a href = "http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-get-started" target = "blank">WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER</a>. I used clips from the movie <a href="http://www.thesocialnetwork-movie.com/" target="_blank">"THE SOCIAL NETWORK"</a> and the song "Sexy Boy" performed by Air.<br />

I have also done a lot of <strong>volunteer work</strong> from 2004 until 2010 for <a href="http://www.animalallies.com" target="_blank">Animal Allies</a>, a company which helps homeless cats. In the beginning I fostered homeless cats. I kept them at my apartment and on weekends, I took them to cat shows until they found a kind owner to adopt them. Since I was a software engineer, I also worked on the yearly calendar, which I created in <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/" target="_blank">Microsoft Power Point</a>. I arranged the photos and helped write the text. I also used <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> to alter the photos so they look as professional as possible. I used Photoshop's layer feature to add several cats in a single photo, place them against a different background, change the colors to match the color of the month and so on. All the cats featured in these calendars were rescue cats helped by <a href="http://www.animalallies.com" target="_blank">Animal Allies</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, I adopted a five year old cat, who has mangled ears due to ear mites, and a tendency to bite. No one else wanted her, but for me she was the perfect cat. Her name is Krinkle and she is with me in one of the photos features on this page.</p>

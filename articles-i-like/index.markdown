<p>This page is different from the "Articles I wrote" page. Here I have a series of links to articles, which I find both interesting and informative from a technological or learning perspective.</p>
<p>For me, the best software engineers are the ones who show a keen interest in the latest technologies (<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/288928/Differences-between-MVC-and-MVP-for-Beginners" target="_blank">MVC and MVP</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa260844(v=vs.60).aspx" target="_blank">Best Practices</a>, <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.CleanCodeArgs" target="_blank">Clean Code</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process" target="blank">Rational Unified Process (RUP)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">eXtreme Programming (XP)</a>, etc.), an avid dedication to new approaches to learning and memory retention, and a genuine deference for heteroclite or unorthodox methods of deduction.</p>
<p>Exercises in logic, linguistics and mathematics can expand the mind. And as stated in one of my favorite articles, thinking in a foreign language can improve decision making. I am currently studying German simply because I love the language.</p>
<p>As is apparent from my “Interests” page, I have a plethora of hobbies and interests, among which my interest in philosophy and psychology as they pertain to logic, learning, and memory retention are most pertinent. The ability to code synthatically is only a small part of programming. A concise understanding of the application’s design, its business logic, the company’s vision and its target market are just as critical. What is even more critical is an complete understanding of the company's function, and how the software application that is being programmed can increase the company's profit margin.he</p>
<p><span style="color: #009999;">A well trained mind is better suited to comprehend the abstract layers of computer programming, and the computer as a whole. A programmer places himself/herself at a great disadvantage if he or she restricts his/her knowledge to the programming languages and their syntax.</span></p>
